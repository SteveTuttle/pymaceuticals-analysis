# Pymaceuticals Inc. Analysis
UNC_data_bootcamp_module_5

This repository contains the analysis of pharmaceutical testing data conducted by Pymaceuticals Inc. The data includes the effect of various drug regimens on tumor growth in laboratory mice.

## Overview
This analysis encompasses several key aspects:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Summary statistics of tumor volume for each drug regimen
* Visualizations including bar and pie charts for data distribution
* Identification of outliers and boxplots for treatment comparison
* Line and scatter plots to illustrate tumor volume changes over time and its correlation with mouse weight
* Correlation and regression analysis between mouse weight and tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen

## Dependencies and Setup
The analysis is performed using Python and requires the following dependencies:

* matplotlib
* pandas
* scipy

## Data Source
The analysis utilizes two main datasets:

1. __Mouse Metadata:__ Contains information about each mouse including its ID, sex, age, and weight.
2. __Study Results:__ Provides detailed records of each mouse's response to various drug regimens including timepoint, tumor volume, and metastatic sites.

## Getting Started
To replicate the analysis:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository.

## How to Use
The notebook provides a step-by-step data analysis, with comments and explanations included in the code for clarity.
