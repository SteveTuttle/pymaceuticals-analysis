# statchart-challenge
Challenge 5 for UNC DBC

While doing this challenge I used various websites as reference guides for ideas 
on how to combine this code together for the desired result. 


Websites included:

•	YouTube

•	ChatGPT

•	Matplotlib.org

•	Pandas.org



I also consulted a tutor who was fantastic resource for helping me refine my code.
